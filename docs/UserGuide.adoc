== Introduction
Divelog is a dive log for tracking dives.
Divelog provides a simple way for underwater divers to input details of their dives such as the time they spent at a particular depth, and the application will keep track of their nitrogen levels.
This allows divers to plan their next trip safely. +

We use the PADI dive tables to calculate pressure groups for individual dives, whether the dive is the first dive
or a repeat dive of the day.
Pressure groups are a letter between A to Z which mark the nitrogen
concentration within a diver ("A" corresponds to a scenario where the diver is almost free of nitrogen).
As of v1.3, the pressure group is automatically calculated within a dive, all one needs to enter is their
current pressure group and their ending pressure group is automatically updated.
We are still working on the sortby
`<<sortby>>` feature coming in the upcoming release v1.4. +

For more information on pressure groups (whether you are a recreational diver or looking to become one), you can find out more over at `<<pressure_groups>>` and  `<<FAQ>>`.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `divelog.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Dive Log.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI (as seen in Diagram 1 below) should appear in a few seconds.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add l/LOCATION`, `LOCATION` is a parameter which can be used as `add l/Sentosa`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `l/LOCATION [tz/TIMEZONE]` can be used as `l/Bali tz/+8` or as `l/Bali`.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `pg/A d/10`, `d/10 pg/A` is also acceptable.
* A vertical bar `a|b` means either `a` or `b` will work as inputs.

=== Adding a dive session: `add`
Use this command to adds your new dive session to the Dive Log.

Format: `add ds/DATE_STARTED ts/TIME_DIVE_STARTED de/DATE_ENDED te/TIME_DIVE_ENDED ss/SAFETY_STOP  d/DEPTH  l/LOCATION pg/INITIAL_PRESSURE_GROUP`

TIP: Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters, items in SQUARE_BRACKETS are optional. Order of parameters are fixed as per the format above, meaning if you entered the ts/TIME_DIVE_STARTED before the ds/DATE_STARTED,
the program will not be able to add your dive.

Put a `ts/` before the time started(24 hours format - HHMM), te/time ended (24 hours format - HHMM), d/depth (in metres), l/ location (location name), per dive at v1.0) (optional) and pg/initial pressure group.

_Example:
add ds/04082018 ts/0900 de/04082018  te/1020 ss/1015 d/15 l/Bukit Lagoon pg/C tz/+8_

=== Editing a dive : `edit`

If you made a mistake while adding a new dive, `edit` will come in handy.
`edits` edits an existing dive session in the Dive Log. +
The only parameters you have to input are the data of that specific dive session at `INDEX`

Format: `edit INDEX [ts/TIME_START] [te/TIME_END] [ss/SAFETY_STOP_TIME] [d/DEPTH] [pg/PG_AT_START] [l/LOCATION]...`

****
* Edits the dive at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed dive list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Examples:
`edit 1 pge/F l/Tioman`

=== Setting display units `set_units`
Switches between meters and feet. (App defaults to meters) +
Format: `set_units meters|feet` +
****
* As of v1.3 it only updates the DISPLAY units, not the actual entered units.
* The settings are not saved upon application restart.
****
Example usage: `set feet`

=== Locating dives by location: `find`

Finds dives whose location contain any of the given keywords. +
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `tioman` will match `Tioman`
* Only the location is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
****

Examples:

* `find Bali` +
Returns `Dive at Bali`

=== Deleting a dive : `delete`
Deletes the specified dive from the Dive Log. +
Format: `delete INDEX`

****
* Deletes the dive at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed dive list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`delete 2` +
Deletes the 2nd dive in the Dive Log.
* `find Bali` +
`delete 1` +
Deletes the 1st dive in the results of the `find` command.

=== Selecting a diveSession : `select`
//is this needed LOLOl
Selects the dive identified by the index number used in the displayed dive list. +
Format: `select INDEX`

//to update the rationale for the color code.
****
* Selects the dive and loads the details of the dive at the specified `INDEX`.
* The current pressure group of the start of the dive and end of the dive will be displayed.
* The pressure group is colour-coded based on its severity for easier reference. (Green being ok, orange in danger zone and red means critical)
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed diveSession list.
* The index *must be a positive integer* `1, 2, 3, ...`
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`select 2` +
Selects the 2nd dive in the Dive Log.
* `find Bali` +
`select 1` +
Selects the 1st dive in the results of the `find` command.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo` [[undo]]

Restores the Dive Log to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the Dive Log's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

This command, as the name suggests, clears Dive Log of *all* your previous dive logs and
gives you a clean start to use Dive Log again! +

Format: `clear`

TIP: use `undo` to, _you've guessed it_, undo your mistaken `clear`  and restore all your deleted dive sessions.
    +
     <<undo>>


=== Setting parameters to sort dives : `sortby` [[sortby]] [coming in V1.4]
In V1.3, all dives are sorted automatically according to time and date by default.

Want to view your dives in ranked order by different options? Simply type `sortby` followed by a `KEYWORD`,
 your following `list`, `find` commands will return you all your dive sessions in that particular order. +

Format: `sortby KEYWORD`


WARNING: You can only use the specific keywords below.

.Table of parameters available to sort by
[options="header"]
|=========================================
|Parameter Type                                 |Keyword
|Time                                           |time
|Location (lexicographical)                     |location
|Duration of Dive                               |duration

|=========================================


=== Planning Mode : `newplan` or `normalmode`

The planning mode is a temporary space for you to plan trips and to simulate dives. This is especially important if you
 are planning on a multiple day diving trip! +
 When you enter the planning mode, simply enter simulation dives as per how you would use the other commands normally.

When you exit, all your simulation files will be deleted automatically. In the Current V1.3,
planning mode only supports `add`, `delete` and `edit` commands +

[Coming in V1.4] To convert your simulation files to the actual mode, type `convert`

Format: `newplan` to enter Planning Mode, `normalmode` to exit planning mode.

TIP: When you exit the planning mode, you will return to the state before you entered.

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Finished using Dive Log? This command shuts down Dive Log, and saves your new dive session data for your next use. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

Worry not! Dive Log  saves all your data in the hard disk *automatically* after any command that changes the data. +

There is absolutely no need to save manually.

== About Pressure Groups in recreational diving [[pressure_groups]]
image::PADI_TableOneAndTwo.png[width="790"]
[[Diagram_10]]Diagram 10: PADI Recreational Dive Planner, Table 1 (No Decompression Limits and Group Designation Table)
and Table 2 (Surface Interval Credit Table) +

image::PADI_TableThree.png[width="790"]
[[Diagram_11]]Diagram 11: PADI Recreational Dive Planner, Table 3 (Repetitive Dive Timetable)

The three PADI tables as shown in the above two diagrams (<<Diagram_10>> and <<Diagram_11>>) are normally physically carried along by recreational divers for them to calculate their pressure group manually.

Workflow of a recreational diver who wants to check out his/her pressure group:

.  For the diver's first dive of the day, the diver dives to a depth of 19 metres for 29 minutes. Referring to <<Diagram_10>>, Table 1 (No Decompression Limits and Group Designation Table),
the diver would find the depth (19) at the top row. There is no 19 metres in the table, so the closest rounded-up value is 20 metres. He would then go down that 20m column until he finds 29 minutes,
or the closest rounded up value which is 30 minutes. The diver will then draw his finger along the row to the left to match a character, which is "M". His new pressure group is now "M".
.  For the diver's second and subsequent dives of the day, he would have to refer to table 3 in <<Diagram_11>> (Repetitive Dive Timetable). The diver wants to dive to 10 metres for 15 minutes for his second dive.
The diver has already surfaced for three hours, which is the minimum time for any pressure group to reach the minimum "A" pressure group, as per Table 2 in <<Diagram_10>> (Surface Interval Credit Table).
Finding his current pressure group "A" on the top row of Table 3, he would match the depth he wants to dive to (10m), and get the values 10 at the top and 209 at the bottom.
10 minutes refer the Residual Nitrogen Time (RNT) and 209 minutes refer to the adjusted no decompression limits. The diver has to add the RNT value (10) to his intended/actual diving time (15 minutes), giving a total of 25 minutes
Total Bottom Time (TBT). Going back to Table 1 in <<Diagram_10>>, for a depth of 10 metres and 25 minutes TBT, his new pressure group would be "C".


== FAQ [[FAQ]]

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Dive Log folder.

*Q*: What is the purpose of having a recreational dive planner in the first place? Can't I just dive to whatever depth for as long as I want? +
*A*: The purpose of the Recreational Dive Planner is to make all dives no decompression dives. Proper planning assures that all dives, single or repetitive, are within the no decompression limits by controlling the length of the dive, the depth of the dive, and the sur- face interval between dives.
The Recreational Dive Planner Table is actually three tables linked together. Each of the three tables provides information for planning dives within accepted nitrogen levels.

*Q*: Where can I find out more about PADI dive tables? +
*A*: The 36-page long Instructions for Use official document can be found https://elearning.padi.com/company0/tools/RDP%20InsforUseMet.pdf
