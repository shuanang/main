== PROJECT: DiveLog

== Overview

DiveLog is a command line driven desktop dive log application for divers to calculate their blood nitrogen levels prior to conducting dives.
It was built to help divers plan so as to minimise the risk of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness[decompression sickness]. The app was originally based on https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[Addressbook 4] and
written as part of the requirements for NUS CS2113T in semester 1 of AY2018/2019.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *consistency check between dives*
** What it does: When a dive is added or edited, one must always check whether the dive is valid or not.
One must also check that the addition or change in parameters of the dive does not make the subsequent dives to risky to attempt.
** Justification: This feature is critical for the functioning of the divelog as the individual nitrogen levels depend on the previous dives. If a user enters a dive that is too long or deep he or she must be warned.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects both the `add` and `edit` command. This feature also made calculation of pressuregroups between dives possible.

* *Minor enhancements*:
** Added a `set_units` command which makes the app switch between feet and meters.
** Integration of timezones into calculations.
